# CV - README
Little self-made fun project :)
Here is my CV in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Some known issues:
- The Twitter logo is currently redirecting to Disocrd because I can't seem to find the damm thing. ;
- The "Professional Skills" little reference bars is not acknowledging the right values :( ;
